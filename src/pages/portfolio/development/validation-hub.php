          <h6>While working at Thrillworks, I built a responsive mirco-site that served as a QA tool for the testing of various promotions on a client website. The site quickly grew into a hub, including quick-links to other frequently used client technologies and&nbsp;documents.<br><br></h6>
          <h6>This hub gave everyone easier access to the tools they needed, and improved the QA process, giving greater visibility across all localized regions and their staging/production environments.<br><br></h6>
          <h6>Below are screenshots that show how the site looks and works, however, the images have been heavily redacted to maintain privacy&nbsp;rights.</h6>
