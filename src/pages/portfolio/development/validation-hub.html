        <p>While working at Thrillworks, I built a responsive mirco-site that served as a QA tool for the testing of various
          promotions on a client website. The site quickly grew into a hub, including quick-links to other frequently used
          client technologies and&nbsp;documents.
          <br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p>This hub gave everyone easier access to the tools they needed, and improved the QA process, giving greater visibility
          across all localized regions and their staging/production environments.
          <br>
          <br>

        <p>Below are screenshots that show how the site looks and works, however, the images have been heavily redacted to maintain
          privacy&nbsp;rights.</p>
