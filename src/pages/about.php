  <!-- INTRODUCTION (MY STORY) -->
  <div class="section white">
    <div class="row">
      <div id="about-intro" class="large-12 columns">
        <h2 class="fadeIn wow">My Story</h2>
        <p class="fadeIn wow">My name is <b>Corey Noble</b>, I am a <b>Front-End Web&nbsp;Developer</b> currently working for <a href="http://www.thrillworks.com/" id="thrillworks-text" target="_blank"><b>Thrillworks&nbsp;Inc.</b></a> in the beautiful city of Burlington, ON -&nbsp;Canada. I have a lot of passion for digital media and love discovering new technologies as they&nbsp;emerge.</p>
        <p class="fadeIn wow">I began working in digital media in highschool, taking as many media classes as possible. At the time I wanted to create environments in videogames. This lead me to take a two year Multi-Media Design and Production pre-requisite program at Fanshawe College. It was in this program that I was introducted to website development. I fell in love with the complex and creative role that web development provides. I enjoyed learing about the many parts of digital media that contributed to a completed web project. To me, graduating from this course was the beginning of my career as a Web&nbsp;Developer.</p>
        <p class="fadeIn wow">After I graduated from Multi-Media Design and Production, I followed through with my original goal and entered the proceeding 3D Animation and Character Design program. The 3D program was immensly difficult, but amazing. I had an industry veteran as my primary teacher for 80% of the classes I took. Due to the shorter than average timespan of this 3D course (1 year opposed to the average 3 years), our teacher pushed us to the very edge of our potential in a very condensed&nbsp;timeline.</p>
        <p class="fadeIn wow">Many people that work with me are amazed at the amount of dedication, concentration and the general attitude I have towards my profession. I concider the 3D program to be the reason for this. If I had any bad habits before the 3D course, they were broken by the time I graduated from 3D Animation and Character&nbsp;Design.</p>
        <p class="fadeIn wow">While I loved both of my fields of study, post-graduation I chose to enter Web Development. Since then I started a freelance web development company with a college friend, then moved on to work at Thrillworks Inc. as a Web Production Specialist. Want to know my history? Keep&nbsp;scrolling.</p>

          <p class="fadeIn wow">In 3D Animation and Character design I honed the skills that are used in all aspects of Game Development and Computer Graphics. However, I believe the most valuable skills I learned from this program are Time Management, Project Management and Team Collaboration&nbsp;skills.</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="fadeIn wow"><b>Time Management</b> – Our assignments were always under very strict timelines and Time Managment was the key to passing the course. Today, I concider this the most valuable skill I&nbsp;have.</li>
            <li class="fadeIn wow"><b>Project Management</b> – We often had multiple projects on-the-go with competing deadlines. Dedicated focus on project management was&nbsp;nessesary.</li>
            <li class="fadeIn wow"><b>Team Collaboration</b> – We created platformer and isometric shooter games in groups ranging from 5-6 people. I learned all about the tensions that build in a team under strict deadlines and how to deal with the stress of team members that aren't getting along or performing at their&nbsp;role.</li>
            <li class="fadeIn wow"><b>Constructive Criticism</b> – Our teacher was an industry veteran who was very critical about feedback. He was our client and if something wasn't up to spec, we had to rectify it. I learned very quickly the importance of listening and adhering to the feedback and critisisms of my&nbsp;work.</li>
            <li class="no-bottom-space fadeIn wow"><b>Technical Skills</b> – The Technical skills I honed in this program are: <i>Concept Art, Sculpting, Retopology + Mesh-Optimization, Upwrapping + Texturing, Rigging + Animation, Lighting + Rendering, Game&nbsp;Development</i>.</li>
