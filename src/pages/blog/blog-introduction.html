      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">This is a space for me to talk about the work I do, communicate ideas that I have, discuss topics that are on my mind, and share the processes I use to create beautiful websites and graphics.</p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">As I learn throughout my career and continue to post to this archive, I hope that this blog will turn into a resource for me to look back on, reflect, and grow.</p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">At the time of writing this I am 23 years old. I have been through 3 extensive years of college study; I have worked as a game developer, started a web development company, and I am now a
        <strong>Web&nbsp;Production&nbsp;Specialist</strong> at
        <a href="//thrillworks.com/" class="thrillworks-text" target="_blank">
          <strong>Thrillworks&nbsp;Inc.</strong>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100"> I love working on the web because it provides a wealth of job opportunities and varying types of technologies to learn in and challenge myself. I consider myself lucky to have found a career that I love this early in life. I enjoy the work that I do and I try not to take that for granted.</p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">This blog is an expression of myself, a way for me to take a snapshot in time and save my thoughts. I try to be an open person, so please continue through my blog if you are interested in the things I have to say and the work I have to show.</p>
