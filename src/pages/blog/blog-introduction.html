      <h3 class="fadeIn wow">Welcome to my blog</h3>
      <p class="fadeIn wow">This is a space for me to talk about the work I do, communicate ideas that I have, discuss topics that are on my mind,
        and share the processes I use to create beautiful websites and graphics.</p>
      <p class="fadeIn wow">As I learn throughout my career and continue to post to this archive, I hope that this blog will turn into a resource
        for me to look back on, reflect, and grow.</p>
      <p class="fadeIn wow">At the time of writing this I am 23 years old. I have been through 3 extensive years of college study; I have worked
        as a game developer, started a web development company, and I am now a

      <p class="fadeIn wow"> I love working on the web because it provides a the wealth of job opportunites and varying types of technologies to
        learn in and challenge myself. I concider myself lucky to have found a career that I love this early in life. I enjoy
        the work that I do and I try not to take that for granted. </p>
      <p class="fadeIn wow">This blog is an expression of myself, a way for me to take a snapshot in time and save my thoughts. I try to be an
        open person, so please continue through my blog if you are interested in the things I have to say and the work I
        have to show.</p>
