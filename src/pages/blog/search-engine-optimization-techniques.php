          <h3 class="fadeInDown wow" >How do Search Engines&nbsp;Operate?</h3>
          <p class="fadeInDown wow" >Popular search engines like <a href="http://www.google.com/" title="Google" target="_blank"><u>Google</u></a> and <a href="http://www.bing.com/" title="Bing" target="_blank"><u>Bing</u></a> rank websites by comparing the relevance of the content on a website, with the context of a users query. The more relevant and your website is to the query determines how high up on the list a search engine will display your&nbsp;website.</p>
          <p class="fadeInDown wow" >Search engines have two major&nbsp;functions:</p>
          <ol>
            <li class="fadeInDown wow" >Crawling everything on the web, incluing: websites, pages, files and documents. Then building a ranked index of the web content, based on topic relevance, quality and accessibility of the&nbsp;content.</li>
            <li class="fadeInDown wow" >Providing users with a list of the websites they've determined are the most relevant to the users&nbsp;query.</li>

          <h3 class="fadeInDown wow" >What is Search Engine Ranking and Why is it&nbsp;Important?</h3>
          <p class="fadeInDown wow" >The rank of a webpage determines how high up on the search list the page is displayed. Page rank is based on a number of different&nbsp;factors.</p>
          <p class="fadeInDown wow" >One of the most important factors is the quantity, quality and popularity of external websites that contain links pointing to your webpage. The more external websites that point to your website, the easier it is for search engines to validate the importance of your website. This also attracts more users to your website which in-turn shows the search engine that your content&nbsp;matters. If your brand or website does not have a lot of recognition, this may be diserning. Not to worry, there are many other ways to increase page rank.</p>
          <p class="fadeInDown wow" >It is important to reasearch your toughest competition. If you know how they cater their content towards the public, you can adjust yours to have more contextual meaning and relevance than theirs. Just as importantly, you can better cater to the demographic of person viewing your content, moreso than your competition&nbsp;does.</p>
          <p class="fadeInDown wow" >The following document is a great beginners guide to what SEO is, why a website needs it and how search engines come into play. The document was created by industry experts and is a great starting point for anyone who wants to know&nbsp;SEO.</p>

<!--
          <p class="fadeInDown wow" >Search engines strive to provide the best possible results for each query, and because of that take landing page experience into account when ranking search results. Good landing page experience (as shown by long clicks and low bounce rate) helps improve search rankings for a given page.</p>
          <p class="fadeInDown wow" >Appealing, useful content is crucial to search engine optimization. Every search performed at the engines comes with an intent—to find, learn, solve, buy, fix, treat, or understand. Search engines place web pages in their results in order to satisfy that intent in the best possible way. Crafting fulfilling, thorough content that addresses searchers' needs improves your chance to earn top rankings.</p>
