      <!-- Body -->
      <h2 class="h3 fadeIn wow">What is Web Production Specialist?</h2>
      <p class="fadeIn wow">In short, a Web Production Specialist at Thrillworks is a 'Jack of all trades' role with focus on: Content authoring,
        email campaigns, web production graphics, and front-end web development.</p>
      <!-- Finish Intro -->
      <p class="fadeIn wow">Below are examples of various tasks and methods that are required of my position on a day-to-day basis.</p>

      <hr class="fadeIn wow">

      <!-- Web Production Graphics -->
      <h2 class="h3 fadeIn wow">Web Production Graphics</h2>
      <p class="fadeIn wow">Using photo-editing software, primarilly Adobe Photoshop; I manipulate designs and output images to work with the needs
        of a project. This can include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Slicing and saving out optimized images in various file types and dimensions.</li>
        <li>Updating fonts, copy, colour, UIs and graphics.</li>
        <li>Translating content and modifying products.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="fadeIn wow">I am typically provided finished designs and it is my job to ensure all graphics are ready for production. If there
        is re-work required on a design or asset, it is typically my job to make adjustments.</p>

      <hr class="fadeIn wow">

      <!-- Email Campaigns -->
      <h2 class="h3 fadeIn wow">Email Campaigns</h2>
      <p class="fadeIn wow">Using technologies like Exact Target and Customer.io, I build, test and deploy .html and .txt email campaigns.</p>
      <p class="fadeIn wow">Typical Process:</p>
      <ol>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">I am provided .PSDs of approved emails. I slice out the images that I need and save them out as web graphics with
          specific naming conventions.</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">I upload all of the sliced images to the email client and note their final URLs / dimensions so I can rapidly add
          images to the .html later on.</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">I copy a pre-existing email with the structure that is closest to what I need. Typically the header and footer stay
          the same as a pre-existing email so copying is more expedient to the process.</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">I gut the copied emails (.html and .txt) and keep only the structure that will be required for the build.</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">I build out the emails by referencing any spreadsheets, copydecks and designs that have been provided. This is when
          I add all of the images, anylitics, alt text, links, and copy.</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">When done, I upload the .html and .txt files to the email client and send test emails to myself and internal leadership
          for review. Then there is a feedback loop, first internally, then with the client.</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">When all emails are ready to be sent there can be some additional criteria to be met. That can involve:
          <ul>
            <li>Setting up a scheduled deployment in batches (eg. 15,000/hr) to account for server load on popular campaigns.</li>
            <li>Partitoning subscibers for region specific campaigns.</li>
            <li>Hooking up dynamically generated content (eg. QR Codes).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <hr class="fadeIn wow">

      <!-- Content Authoring -->
      <h2 class="h3 fadeIn wow">Content Authoring</h2>
      <p class="fadeIn wow">As a Web Production Specialist I author web pages, edit content and hook up assets using Content Management Systems.
        The technologies I use most often are Adobe&nbsp;Experience&nbsp;Manager, Open Text's RedDot, WordPress, Magento,
        SiteCore and Joomla.</p>
      <p class="fadeIn wow">The tasks I perform can include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">Creating and building new web pages based on provided copydecks, spreadsheets and/or designs.</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">Modifying existing web pages.</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">Creating and managing multi-lingual versions of web pages.</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">Managing and hooking up digital assets (images, videos, documents).</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">Managing products, promotional banners and press releases.</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">Workflowing pages from Author to Staging, and from Staging to Production.</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">Versioning pages, Backing up files and managing page data.</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">Setting up anylitics, meta-data and page re-directs.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr class="fadeIn wow">

      <!-- Front-End Web Development -->
      <h2 class="h3 fadeIn wow">Front-End Web Development</h2>
      <p class="fadeIn wow">Front-End Web Deveopment involves creating or modifying websites with HTML, SCSS, Javascript and PHP code. When I work
        on a Front-End project, typically it includes many of the tasks in 'Content Authoring', but can also include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">Creating/Pulling a code repository onto my computer, and using source control to manage the project.</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">Using a front-end framework and HTML/SCSS/JS/PHP to develop and modify web projects.</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">Collaborating with other developers, ensuring code standards are met and that there are no conflicts in the repository.</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">Staging project work on a testing environment and providing testing URLs.</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">Creating packages for production or publishing approved work.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr class="fadeIn wow">

      <!-- Ticket Tracking -->
      <h2 class="h3 fadeIn wow">Ticket Tracking</h2>
      <p class="fadeIn wow">Once a deliverable has been sent for review, any issues that have been spotted are turned into tasks using software
        like JIRA. We use this ticket process to ensure all issues are tracked, marked for their importance, and eventually
        resolved. This gives everyone oversight on the project, its status and the amount of work left to&nbsp;do.</p>

      <hr class="fadeIn wow">

      <!-- Training Documentation -->
      <h2 class="h3 fadeIn wow">Training Documentation</h2>
      <p class="fadeIn wow">If a new process is developed, or if a client/internal staff require training on a process, we create detailed training
        documentation. This includes a step-by-step document with both a visual and textual representation of the process.
        In the document we include as many relvant resources and examples as possible.</p>
      <p class="fadeIn wow">Internal documentation at Thrillworks is created as a Wiki. Documents to clients are provided in the format that they
        are requested in, typically designed PDFs.</p>

      <hr class="fadeIn wow">

      <!-- Agile Methodoligy -->
      <h2 class="h3 fadeIn wow">Agile Methodoligy</h2>
      <p class="fadeIn wow">Thrillworks <strong>used</strong> to take a waterfall approach to project work. A waterfall process involves starting a project with one department
        (UX) and moving through the other departments (Design/Copy > Development/Production > QA) one after another, until
        a project is complete. This was problematic as the departments further down the chain would often see their timelines
        cut due to discrepencies with departments up the chain. This created stress and affected profit margins.</p>
      <p class="fadeIn wow">Their solution to this problem was to completely revamp the way work was done at Thrillworks. The company brought in
        specialists on Agile development and the everyone learned Agile Methodoligy.</p>
      <p class="fadeIn wow">Agile Methodoligy is a very different approach to project work, opposed to the typical waterfall approach. It allows
        Thrillworks to increase profit and accellerate timelines.</p>
      <p class="fadeIn wow">A breif synopsis of Agile:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">No more departments. Teams are created to handle specific clients. These teams include the skillsets that cover the
          needs of the client.</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">A new workflow process in-which a project is broken down into pieces of work, as granularly as possible and marked
          with time estimates. All of the pieces of work are put up on a board and categoriezed by their stauts: backlog,
          in progress, blocked, ready for review or completed. Tasks are taken by a team member with the skills to work on
          it, they 'own' it for the time they are working on it. Due to this approach, some work that would normally start
          later in the process can start almost immediately. Nobody is ever working on the same work at the same time, this
          avoids project collision.</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">Daily team meetings occur to bring up concerns and keep the status of projects in-check.</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">Retrospectives meetings are scheduled to help iron out issues that came up throughout a project. This helps improve
          upon processes for the next time.</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">Employees are T-shaped, meaning that they are encouraged to help out when they can, even if it is a different workflow
          or technology that they are not used to. This helps ensure there are no knowledge silos and that teams share the
          workload.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr class="fadeIn wow">

      <!-- Special Projects -->
      <h2 class="h3 fadeIn wow">Special Projects</h2>
      <p class="fadeIn wow">Sometimes there are opportunities at Thrillworks to pursue special projects. These opportunities can come from an internal
        initiative to better the company, or, if time permits, the opportunity for self improvement. This can include learning
        new technologies, developing new business skills or building tools that help ease the burden of a task. In the 2.5
        years I have worked at Thrillworks I have been able to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">Create an internal quality assurance tool that displays all of the promotional banners on a client website. The tool
          shows the banners on their staging and production environments. It allows for a quick comparison between the two
          environments, and helps speed up the testing process.</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">Create a new process for developing responsive email campaigns. Using Foundation for Emails, I created and fully
          tested email templates that accounted for every use case Thrillworks might need when it comes to responsive email
          development. This was a major upgrade to their original process and allowed Thrillworks to expand on the services
          they offer as a company.</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">Develop a learning initiative on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). This involved creating learning
          material based on the WCAG guidelines; Creating testing material and working labs. This initiative ensures all
          staff are aware of the legal accessibility requirements that all websites need to meet.</li>
        <li class="fadeIn wow">Collaborate with a team of 7 people to introduce and standardize the company-wide use of a digital Kanban board software.</li>
      </ul>
