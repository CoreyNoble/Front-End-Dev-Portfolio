      <!-- Body -->
      <h2 class="h3" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">What is Web Production Specialist?</h2>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">In short, a Web Production Specialist at Thrillworks is a 'Jack of all trades' role with focus on: Content authoring, email campaigns, web production graphics, and front-end web development.</p>
      <!-- Finish Intro -->
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Below are examples of various tasks and methods that are required of my position on a day-to-day basis.</p>

      <hr data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">

      <!-- Web Production Graphics -->
      <h2 class="h3" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Web Production Graphics</h2>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Using photo-editing software, primarily Adobe Photoshop; I manipulate designs and output images to work with the needs of a project. This can include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Slicing and saving out optimized images in various file types and dimensions.</li>
        <li>Updating fonts, copy, colour, UIs and graphics.</li>
        <li>Translating content and modifying products.</li>
      </ul>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">I am typically provided finished designs and it is my job to ensure all graphics are ready for production. If there is re-work required on a design or asset, it is typically my job to make adjustments.</p>

      <hr data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">

      <!-- Email Campaigns -->
      <h2 class="h3" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Email Campaigns</h2>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Using technologies like Exact Target and Customer.io, I build, test and deploy .html and .txt email campaigns.</p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Typical Process:</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">I am provided .PSDs of approved emails. I slice out the images that I need and save them out as web graphics with specific naming conventions.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">I upload all of the sliced images to the email client and note their final URLs / dimensions so I can rapidly add images to the .html later on.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">I copy a pre-existing email with the structure that is closest to what I need. Typically the header and footer stay the same as a pre-existing email so copying is more expedient to the process.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">I gut the copied emails (.html and .txt) and keep only the structure that will be required for the build.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">I build out the emails by referencing any spreadsheets, copydecks and designs that have been provided. This is when I add all of the images, analytics, alt text, links, and copy.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">When done, I upload the .html and .txt files to the email client and send test emails to myself and internal leadership for review. Then there is a feedback loop, first internally, then with the client.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">When all emails are ready to be sent there can be some additional criteria to be met. That can involve:
          <ul>
            <li>Setting up a scheduled deployment in batches (e.g. 15,000/hr) to account for server load on popular campaigns.</li>
            <li>o	Partitioning subscribers for region specific campaigns.</li>
            <li>Hooking up dynamically generated content (e.g. QR Codes).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <hr data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">

      <!-- Content Authoring -->
      <h2 class="h3" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Content Authoring</h2>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">As a Web Production Specialist I author web pages, edit content and hook up assets using Content Management Systems. The technologies I use most often are Adobe&nbsp;Experience&nbsp;Manager, Open Text's RedDot, WordPress, Magento, SiteCore and Joomla.</p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">The tasks I perform can include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Creating and building new web pages based on provided copydecks, spreadsheets and/or designs.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Modifying existing web pages.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Creating and managing multi-lingual versions of web pages.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Managing and hooking up digital assets (images, videos, documents).</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Managing products, promotional banners and press releases.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Promoting pages through workflow from Author to Staging, and from Staging to Production.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Versioning pages, backing up files and managing page data.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Setting up analytics, meta-data and page re-directs.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">

      <!-- Front-End Web Development -->
      <h2 class="h3" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Front-End Web Development</h2>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Front-End Web Development involves creating or modifying websites with HTML, SCSS, JavaScript and PHP code. When I work on a Front-End project, typically it includes many of the tasks in 'Content Authoring', but can also include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Creating/Pulling a code repository onto my computer, and using source control to manage the project.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Using a front-end framework and HTML/SCSS/JS/PHP to develop and modify web projects.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Collaborating with other developers, ensuring code standards are met and that there are no conflicts in the repository.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Staging project work on a testing environment and providing testing URLs.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Creating packages for production or publishing approved work.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">

      <!-- Ticket Tracking -->
      <h2 class="h3" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Ticket Tracking</h2>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Once a deliverable has been sent for review, any issues that have been spotted are turned into tasks using software like JIRA. We use this ticket process to ensure all issues are tracked, marked for their importance, and eventually resolved. This gives everyone oversight on the project, its status and the amount of work left to&nbsp;do.</p>

      <hr data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">

      <!-- Training Documentation -->
      <h2 class="h3" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Training Documentation</h2>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">If a new process is developed, or if a client/internal staff require training on a process, we create detailed training documentation. This includes a step-by-step document with both a visual and textual representation of the process. In the document we include as many relevant resources and examples as possible.</p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Internal documentation at Thrillworks is created as a Wiki. Documents to clients are provided in the format that they are requested in, typically designed PDFs.</p>

      <hr data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">

      <!-- Agile Methodology -->
      <h2 class="h3" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Agile Methodology</h2>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Thrillworks <strong>used</strong> to take a waterfall approach to project work. A waterfall process involves starting a project with one department (UX) and moving through the other departments (Design/Copy > Development/Production > QA) one after another, until a project is complete. This was problematic as the departments further down the chain would often see their timelines cut due to discrepancies with departments up the chain. This created stress and affected profit margins.</p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Their solution to this problem was to completely revamp the way work was done at Thrillworks. The company brought in specialists on Agile development and the everyone learned Agile Methodology.</p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Agile Methodology is a very different approach to project work, opposed to the typical waterfall approach. It allows Thrillworks to increase profit and accelerate timelines.</p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">A brief synopsis of Agile:</p>
      <ul>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">No more departments. Teams are created to handle specific clients. These teams include the skillsets that cover the needs of the client.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">A new workflow process in-which a project is broken down into pieces of work, as granularly as possible and marked with time estimates. All of the pieces of work are put up on a board and categorized by their status: backlog, in progress, blocked, ready for review or completed. Tasks are taken by a team member with the skills to work on it, they 'own' it for the time they are working on it. Due to this approach, some work that would normally start later in the process can start almost immediately. Nobody is ever working on the same work at the same time, this avoids project collision.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Daily team meetings occur to bring up concerns and keep the status of projects in-check.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Retrospectives meetings are scheduled to help iron out issues that came up throughout a project. This helps improve upon processes for the next time.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Employees are T-shaped, meaning that they are encouraged to help out when they can, even if it is a different workflow or technology that they are not used to. This helps ensure there are no knowledge silos and that teams share the workload.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Special Projects -->
      <h2 class="h3" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Special Projects</h2>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Sometimes there are opportunities at Thrillworks to pursue special projects. These opportunities can come from an internal initiative to better the company, or, if time permits, the opportunity for self-improvement. This can include learning new technologies, developing new business skills or building tools that help ease the burden of a task. In the 2.5 years I have worked at Thrillworks I have been able to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Create an internal quality assurance tool that displays all of the promotional banners on a client website. The tool shows the banners on their staging and production environments. It allows for a quick comparison between the two environments, and helps speed up the testing process.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Create a new process for developing responsive email campaigns. Using Foundation for Emails, I created and fully tested email templates that accounted for every use case Thrillworks might need when it comes to responsive email development. This was a major upgrade to their original process and allowed Thrillworks to expand on the services they offer as a company.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Develop a learning initiative on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). This involved creating learning material based on the WCAG guidelines; Creating testing material and working labs. This initiative ensures all staff are aware of the legal accessibility requirements that all websites need to meet.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Collaborate with a team of 7 people to introduce and standardize the company-wide use of a digital Kanban board software.</li>
      </ul>
