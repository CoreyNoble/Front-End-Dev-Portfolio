          <h3 class="fadeInDown wow">What is Web Production Specialist?</h3>
          <p class="fadeInDown wow">In short, a Web Production Specialist at Thrillworks is a 'jack of all trades' role with focus on content authoring, email campaigns, web production graphics, and front-end web development.</p>
          <!-- Finish Intro -->
          <p class="fadeInDown wow">Below are examples of various tasks that may be required of my position, on a day-to-day basis.</p>

          <!-- Email Campaigns -->
          <h3 class="fadeInDown wow">Email Campaigns</h3>
          <p class="fadeInDown wow">Using technologies like Exact Target and Customer.io, I build, test and deploy .html and .txt email campaigns.</p>
          <p class="fadeInDown wow">Typical Process:</p>
          <ol>
            <li class="fadeInDown wow">I am provided .psd designs of approved emails. I slice out the images that I need and save them out as web graphics with specific naming conventions.</li>
            <li class="fadeInDown wow">I upload all of the sliced images to the email client server and note their final URLs and dimensions so I can rapidly add images to the .html later on.</li>
            <li class="fadeInDown wow">I copy a pre-existing email with the structure that is closest to what I need. Typically the header and footer stay the same as a pre-existing email so copying is more expedient to the process.</li>
            <li class="fadeInDown wow">I gut the copied emails (.html and .txt) and keep only the structure that will be required for the build.</li>
            <li class="fadeInDown wow">I build out the emails by referencing any spreadsheets, copydecks and designs that have been provided. This is when I add all of the images, anylitics, alt text, links, and copy.</li>
            <li class="fadeInDown wow">When done, I send test emails to internal staff for review.</li>
            <li class="fadeInDown wow">After the review process, typically a few items will need to change. I make any nessesary updates and re-send test emails.</li>
            <li class="fadeInDown wow">When all emails are ready to be sent there can be some additional criteria to be met. That can involve:
                <ul>
                    <li>Setting up a scheduled deployment in batches (eg. 15,000/hr) to account for server load on popular campaigns.</li>
                    <li>Partitoning subscibers for region specific campaigns.</li>
                    <li>Hooking up dynamically generated content (eg. QR Codes).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <!-- Web Production Graphics -->
          <h3 class="fadeInDown wow">Web Production Graphics</h3>

          <hr class="fadeInDown wow">
            
          <!-- Content Authoring -->
          <h3 class="fadeInDown wow">Content Authoring</h3>
          <p class="fadeInDown wow">Using technologies like WordPress, RedDot, Magento, SiteCore and Adobe Experience Manager I manage websites.</p>
          <p class="fadeInDown wow">This can include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="fadeInDown wow">Creating new web pages from provided copydecks, spreadsheets and/or designs.</li>
            <li class="fadeInDown wow">Modifying existing web pages.</li>
            <li class="fadeInDown wow">Creating and managing multi-lingual versions of web pages.</li>

          <!-- Front-End Web Development -->
          <h3 class="fadeInDown wow">Front-End Web Development</h3>
          <p class="fadeInDown wow">Front-End Web Deveopment involves creating websites and web components with HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP code. When I am asked to work on a Front-End project, typically it involves:</p>
          <ul>
              <li class="fadeInDown wow">Pulling a code repository onto my computer and using source control to manage the project.</li>
              <li class="fadeInDown wow">Using a front-end framework and SCSS to develop/modify web pages and components.</li>
              <li class="fadeInDown wow">Providing testing URLs when completed.</li>

          <!-- Ticket Tracking -->
          <h3 class="fadeInDown wow">Ticket Tracking</h3>
          <p class="fadeInDown wow">Once a deliverable has been sent to QA and the project team, any issues that have been spotted are turned into tickets that are tracked using JIRA and a project number. We use this ticket process to track the number of issues and their importance. We mark the status of the issues and talk about them on a granular level. This gives everyone on the project oversight.</p>
            
          <hr class="fadeInDown wow">
          
          <!-- Training Documentation -->
          <h3 class="fadeInDown wow">Training Documentation</h3>
          <p class="fadeInDown wow">If a new process is developed, or a client/internal staff require training on a process, we create detailed training documentation. This includes a step-by-step document with both visual and textual representation of the process. We try to include as many relvant resources and examples as possible, and when we solve a task we  either edjucate as to why we use a particular process, or explain alternative methods.</p>
          <p class="fadeInDown wow">Internal documentation at Thrillworks is created as a Wiki, using Confluence. Documents to clients are provided in the format that they are requested in, typically designed PDFs.</p>

          <!-- Special Projects -->
          <h3 class="fadeInDown wow">Special Projects</h3>
          <p class="fadeInDown wow">If there is any free time at Thrillworks, I am able to pursue special projects. This can include learning new technologies, developing new business skillsets or building tools that help ease the burden of a task. In the 2 years I have worked at Thrillworks I have been able to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="fadeInDown wow">Create an internal website to help identify the various banners on a client website, Staging and Production. It allows for a quick comparison between the two, and helps speed up the QA of Owned Assets.</li>
            <li class="fadeInDown wow">Create a new process for developing responsive email campaigns. Using Foundation for Emails, I created and fully tested a email templates that accounted for every use case Thrillworks might need when it comes to responsive email development. This was a major upgrade to their original process and allowed Thrillworks to expand on the services they offer as a company.</li>
            <li class="fadeInDown wow">Developed a Web Content Accessibility Guidelines initiative that involved creating learning material, testing material and labs.</li>
           </ul>

          <!-- Agile Methodoligy -->
          <h3 class="fadeInDown wow">Agile Methodoligy</h3>
          <p class="fadeInDown wow">Thrillworks used to have a waterfall approach to web development. This means that a project would start with one department, and make its way through the departments until a project was completed. This was problematic as projects could get stuck and timelines would be tight as a result, creating stress and affecting the bottom line. Their solution to this problem was to completely revamp the way work was done at Thrillworks. They brought in Agile specialists and the entire company learned Agile Methodoligy.</p>
          <p class="fadeInDown wow">Agile Methodoligy includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="fadeInDown wow">No more departments. Teams are created to handle specific clients and include the skillsets that cover the needs of the client.</li>
            <li class="fadeInDown wow">A new workflow process in-which a project is broken down into pieces of work, as granularly as possible. All of the pieces of work are put up on a board in 'swim-lanes' and marked as either backlog, in-progress, blocked, staging, completed. Due to this approach, work can start almost immediately, with enough oversight for everyone to be able to work individually without affecting another.</li>
            <li class="fadeInDown wow">Daily team meetings occur to bring up concerns and keep the status of projects in-check.</li>
            <li class="fadeInDown wow">Retrospectives meetings are scheduled to help iron out issues that came up throughout a project. This helps improve upon processes for the next time.</li>
            <li class="fadeInDown wow">Employees are T-shaped, meaning that they are encouraged to help out when they can, even if it is a different workflow or technology that they are not used to. This helps ensure there are no knowledge silos and teams work well together.</li>
