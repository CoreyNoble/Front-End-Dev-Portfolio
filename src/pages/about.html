<!-- INTRODUCTION (MY STORY) -->
<div class="section white">
  <div class="row">
    <div id="about-intro" class="small-12 column">
      <h2 data-aos="fade-up">My Story</h2>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">My name is
        <strong>Corey Noble</strong>, I am a
        <strong>Web&nbsp;Developer</strong> currently working for
        <a href="http://www.thrillworks.com/" class="thrillworks-text" target="_blank">
          <strong>Thrillworks&nbsp;Inc.</strong>
        </a> in the beautiful city of Burlington, ON -&nbsp;Canada. I have a lot of passion for digital media and love discovering
        new technologies as they&nbsp;emerge.</p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">I began working in digital media in highschool, taking as many media classes as possible. At the time I wanted to create
        environments in videogames. This lead me to take a two year Multi-Media Design and Production pre-requisite program
        at Fanshawe College. It was in this program that I was introducted to website development. I fell in love with the
        complex and creative role that web development provides. I enjoyed learing about the many parts of digital media
        that contributed to a completed web project. To me, graduating from this course was the beginning of my career as
        a Web&nbsp;Developer.</p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">After I graduated from Multi-Media Design and Production, I followed through with my original goal and entered the
        proceeding 3D Animation and Character Design program. The 3D program was immensly difficult, but amazing. I had an
        industry veteran as my primary teacher for 80% of the classes I took. Due to the shorter than average timespan of
        this 3D course (1 year opposed to the average 3 years), our teacher pushed us to the very edge of our potential in
        a very condensed&nbsp;timeline.</p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">Many people that work with me are amazed at the amount of dedication, concentration and the general attitude I have
        towards my profession. I concider the 3D program to be the reason for this. If I had any bad habits before the 3D
        course, they were broken by the time I graduated from 3D Animation and Character&nbsp;Design.</p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">While I loved both of my fields of study, post-graduation I chose to enter Web Development. Since then I started a
        freelance web development company with a college friend, then moved on to work at Thrillworks Inc. as a Web Production
        Specialist. Next I was promoted to Developer and the whole time I have been working on amazing and challenging projects.
        I'm always learning and growing my skillset. Want to know my history? Keep&nbsp;scrolling.</p>

      <p data-aos="fade-up">In 3D Animation and Character design I honed the skills that are used in all aspects of Game Development and Computer
        Graphics. However, I believe the most valuable skills I learned from this program are Time Management, Project Management
        and Team Collaboration&nbsp;skills.</p>
      <ul>
        <li data-aos="fade-up">
          <strong>Time Management</strong> – Our assignments were always under very strict timelines and Time Managment was the key to
          passing the course. Today, I concider this the most valuable skill I&nbsp;have.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up">
          <strong>Project Management</strong> – We often had multiple projects on-the-go with competing deadlines. Dedicated focus on
          project management was a necessity.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up">
          <strong>Team Collaboration</strong> – We created platformer and isometric shooter games in groups ranging from 5-6 people. I
          learned all about the tensions that build in a team under strict deadlines and how to deal with the stress of team
          members that aren't getting along or performing at their&nbsp;role.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up">
          <strong>Constructive Criticism</strong> – Our teacher was an industry veteran who was very critical about our work. He was our
          client and if something wasn't up to spec, we had to rectify it. I learned very quickly the importance of listening
          and adhering to the feedback and critisisms pertaining to my&nbsp;work.</li>
        <li class="no-bottom-space" data-aos="fade-up">
          <strong>Technical Skills</strong> – The Technical skills I honed in this program are:
