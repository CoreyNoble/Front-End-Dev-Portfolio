            <p>My name is
              <strong>Corey Noble</strong>, I am a
              <strong>Web&nbsp;Developer</strong> currently working for
              <a href="https://thrillworks.com/" class="thrillworks-text" target="_blank">
                <strong>Thrillworks&nbsp;Inc.</strong>
              </a> in the beautiful city of Burlington,&nbsp;ON -&nbsp;Canada. I have a lot of passion for digital media and love discovering
              new technologies as they&nbsp;emerge.
            </p>
            <p>I began working in digital media in high school. I loved the variety that the digital space provided, so I took as many media classes as I could. At the time I wanted to create environments in videogames. This lead me to take a two year Multi Media Design and Production pre-requisite program at Fanshawe College, with the ultimate goal of taking a 3D course to become a Video Game Developer. It was in this program that I was introduced to website development. I fell in love with the complex and creative role that web development provides. I enjoyed learning about the many parts of digital media that contributed to a completed web project. To me, graduating from this course was the beginning of my career as a Web&nbsp;Developer.</p>
            <p>After I graduated from Multi Media Design and Production, I followed through with my original goal and entered the proceeding 3D Animation and Character Design program. The 3D program was immensely difficult, but amazing. I was mentored by a veteran in the industry. Due to the shorter than average timespan of this 3D course (1 year opposed to the average 3 years), our teacher pushed us to the very edge of our potential in a very condensed&nbsp;timeline. Many people that work with me are amazed at the amount of dedication, concentration and the general attitude I have towards my profession. I consider the 3D program to be the reason for this. If I had any bad habits before the 3D course, they were broken by the time I&nbsp;graduated.</p>
            <p>While I loved both of my fields of study, post-graduation I chose Web Development as my preferred career path. After college, I started a freelance web development company with a college friend, which gave me some of the skills and confidence I needed to pursue an opportunity at a renowned digital agency. I was able to start working at Thrillworks&nbsp;Inc. as a Web Production Specialist. At Thrillworks I have been able to rapidly expand my knowledge of web technologies and software development best practices. I continued to push myself daily to learn new things, and after 3 years at Thrillworks I was promoted to Web Developer. The entire time I have been working with a very talented group of people, on amazing and challenging projects that I am very proud to have had a part in&nbsp;creating.</p>
            <p>I feel blessed to have found my passion so early in life. I love that being a Web Developer means I get to continually learn and grow. I strive to learn and improve every day. Want to know my history? Keep&nbsp;scrolling.</p>

                    passing the course. Today, I consider this one of the most valuable skills I&nbsp;have.</li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Project Management</strong> – We often had multiple projects on-the-go with competing deadlines. Dedicated focus on
                    project management was a necessity.</li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Team Collaboration</strong> – We created platformer and isometric shooter games in groups ranging from 5-6 people. I
                    learned all about the tensions that build in a team under strict deadlines and how to deal with the stress of team
                    members that aren't getting along or performing at their&nbsp;role.</li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Constructive Criticism</strong> – Our teacher was an industry veteran who was very critical about our work. He was our
                    client and if something wasn't up to spec, we had to rectify it. I learned very quickly the importance of listening
                    and adhering to the feedback and criticisms pertaining to my&nbsp;work.</li>
